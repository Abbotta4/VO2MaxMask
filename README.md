# VO<sub>2</sub> Max Mask

This is source for a VO<sub>2</sub> max mask project developed using the
Teensyduino development suite for the Teensy 3.2. The microcontroller
code measures the volume of oxygen consumed in each breath and compares
it to the cardiac output of an athlete. With these measurements,
VO<sub>2</sub> max can be directly measured.
